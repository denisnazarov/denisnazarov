&lt;p&gt;Before the ubiquity of internet services (search, maps, social, commerce), software was more similar in its nature to tools (word processing, spreadsheets, graphics editing).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the permissionless nature of open source code, software tools benefitted from combinatorial innovation and evolved quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet services use software tools (like databases) as their building blocks, but also provide new and advanced functionality that tools aren’t capable of. They are dynamic, social, and collaborative in ways tools are not. A service’s reliance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; makes it fundamentally different than a tool. A service’s software, when instantiated, creates a vessel for persisting state. It starts off empty and becomes useful only when filled with data, users or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business model of internet services is predicated on monetizing state. State is a competitive advantage, and is defended by keeping services proprietary and closed. Further combinatorial innovation of services is restricted because outside developers can’t benefit from true composability of existing services and their underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/&quot;&gt;phonebook of the internet&lt;/a&gt;, while limited in capability, is one of a handful examples of a successful early &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; internet service that resulted in a lot of downstream innovation. Because of incompatible incentives, there are no open internet services today that come close to the complexity or utility of dominant closed ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where crypto comes in. Crypto networks rely on open source code, but also instantiate global services that depend on open state. Open state is a critical requirement for cryptographic verification and provides the lynchpin of trust in blockchains. In addition, tokens create a new incentive model for sustaining crypto networks that is aligned with their open nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conditions for innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial innovation is a cultural process for invention by which existing ideas are combined in novel ways to create new ideas. The resulting output is fed back into the process to generate more new ideas, ad infinitum. As more ideas are explored, more possibilities present themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the analogy of a garden: A healthy garden requires room for growth, ample light, regular watering, and an attentive gardener. Similar prerequisites exist for robust combinatorial innovation: A healthy landscape where a diverse set of products and services can grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a community of inventors must be &lt;strong&gt;interconnected&lt;/strong&gt; through communication technology (language, writing) so ideas can flow widely and efficiently. The presence of a culture of &lt;strong&gt;sharing&lt;/strong&gt; allows ideas to be challenged and refined (scientific method, peer review), and for the strongest ones to rise to the top.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation in a global marketplace for ideas (capitalism) provides the &lt;strong&gt;incentives&lt;/strong&gt; for inventors to compete, driving innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of these together are complex systems. Complex technology naturally leads to &lt;strong&gt;modularity&lt;/strong&gt;. Specialists subdivide and conquer that complexity to improve the building blocks, creating fractal competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is the ultimate environment for combinatorial innovation, excelling in all dimensions at an unprecedented scale: The internet is the ultimate connectivity network. Open source culture continuously refines modules of code. And billions of users with interconnected devices present an unprecedented addressable market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software tools: the user is in control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, software tools are not unlike the products of the industrial era. Like a manufacturing tool, they carry out a particular function, useful in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, early software predominantly produced better digital versions of industrial information and media processing tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Software tool&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Industrial tool&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Word processor (WordPerfect)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Typewriter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Spreadsheet (Excel)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Accounting book&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Graphics editor (Photoshop)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Darkroom&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, as computers became more affordable, ubiquitous and interconnected by the internet, a new breed of service-like software emerged, enabling new modes of communication, collaboration and interaction, upending the top-down models of production and distribution in media industries, and also bringing forth new implications for power and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All tool-like software has certain key properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;self contained&lt;/strong&gt;. Run the code and it’ll do what is promised. There are no external dependencies. Word processor software, for example, is so useful by itself that successful companies were built selling computers with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuX-6761KTQ&quot;&gt;single purpose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offers &lt;strong&gt;single player utility&lt;/strong&gt;. Like a hammer that you own, you don’t need anything or anyone else to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;user is the operator&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a strong sense of ownership, even property, as well as control, for the user. It’s your personal tool, not a service you hire from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies are &lt;strong&gt;interchangeable&lt;/strong&gt;. If you forget your laptop, you can borrow a friend’s and still retouch your pictures in their instance of Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the initial business model for tool-like software was selling licenses. Piracy naturally emerged, since the tools were so useful, but the code was also easy and inexpensive to copy and share. Piracy, in a sense, is natural to the combinatorial innovation process, since intellectual property is a barrier to the flow of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source community rapidly created openly-licensed alternatives to most proprietary software, free to reuse and modify. Since the idea of tool software is synonymous with its utility, anyone can attempt to create an alternate, open version from scratch (even though open source alternatives were often &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP&quot;&gt;inferior&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop&quot;&gt;proprietary&lt;/a&gt; originals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, as connectivity to the internet became commonplace and the web started to pick up steam, the focus of software innovation shifted from digital productivity tools to programming communication and interactivity between computers. Software edged toward offering new capabilities of being collaborative, multiplayer, dynamic, and social, in turn producing the building blocks for the next generation of software, internet services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code vs state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the evolution, it is important to to distinguish between the &lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt; (code) of a program and its &lt;strong&gt;ability to remember&lt;/strong&gt; (state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early software was functional in nature—an input led to an output. A story in your mind is translated to a digital document with the aid of a word processor. A scanned photo is cropped and text is overlaid with image processing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to remember preceding events or user interactions (state) was primitive and minimal. State input also only came from the single user of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet services leveraged sophisticated state management, allowing them to provide unprecedented new utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet services: users give up state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal computing is defined by the idea that a user runs a &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt; instance of a program on &lt;strong&gt;their&lt;/strong&gt; computer. The internet is defined by a new class of software centered around the concept of a &lt;strong&gt;shared&lt;/strong&gt; service that runs on a &lt;strong&gt;remote&lt;/strong&gt; server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of “one computer, one program”, where there are many identical instances of software run by independent individuals, one server operator (or company) runs a single instance of a program on their server (or datacenter). Lots of people connect to that service and interact with it over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, instead of a user maintaining their own state, a service maintains state on a user’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has important consequences. Power shifts away from the user and their private &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rTRzYjoZhIY&quot;&gt;bicycle for the mind&lt;/a&gt;. A new force of consolidation and control emerges. Ironically, the internet, a decentralized communication network, produced some of the most centralizing services in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the generic definition of “service”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a system supplying a public need such as transport, communications, or utilities such as electricity and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services are categorically different than tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tool&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Service&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Car&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Transportation network&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Engine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Power grid&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Personal blog&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Social network&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RSS reader&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Search engine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Google Ads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dota 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MP3 player&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Spotify&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services thrive at scale, from both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale&quot;&gt;economies of scale&lt;/a&gt; (an industrial concept) and a new notion of stateful &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/&quot;&gt;network effects&lt;/a&gt;. They desire to be global and singular. They have long, continuous lifespans and operate autonomously. Like for services in the real world, a failure of an internet service is catastrophic for users that depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users find more value in plugging into an existing service than from building their own, making them naturally become monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services can be deployed in data centers, enabling applications to run at a scale that would be infeasible for a personal computer. Crawling the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; web is possible by a well funded and architected service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State gives services superpowers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user may interact with the service to address a personal need, for example, to find a certain website with the aid of a keyword query. The service satisfies that need by returning a list of results, but a byproduct of the user’s action is the service improving its global state. In the case of search, the user action updates the global ranking of the selected website in the system, improving results for all other users in the future. Even though users are using the service for a selfish reason, the service gets smarter and more useful for all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a service’s lifespan, the utility of its code begins to diverge with the utility of its state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State compounds and becomes more valuable superlinearly. Code, while crucial for the stable operation and evolution of a service, becomes less important and necessary to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that most services are primarily constructed out of open source components. Anyone can attempt to copy a service or even re-instantiate the actual codebase, but an existing service with more users will have more useful state, and will be more desirable to new users. This creates a feedback loop, where more users beget more state, leading to a more useful service that attracts further users and more state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From open source to open services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my partner Chris has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;, we are seeing a great consolidation of internet services among a few corporations. Years of state accumulated by innovative companies produced tremendously useful services (search, maps, social, commerce), but further combinatorial innovation is off-limits to outside developers and entrepreneurs. Rebuilding services from scratch on the same terms and this late in the game is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As crypto networks evolve, they are likely to provide strong incentives to unlock further state and create open services in many areas dominated by closed ones today. Open services powered by crypto networks will present unprecedented opportunity for a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs to innovate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He avoids suggesting specific ones, and instead describes the broader topics or areas of interest that he’s been studying lately. The history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Open-Autobiography-Andre-Agassi/dp/0307388409/&quot;&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to deeply understand a topic he’s interested in, Cowen says he compiles and reads a pile of books on a subject rather than reading a single book. To rephrase an old saying, the pile is greater than the sum of its books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of reading piles of books is called &lt;em&gt;syntopical reading&lt;/em&gt; in Adler’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughtfullfilling.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-to-read-book-review.html&quot;&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/a&gt;. According to Adler’s levels of reading, syntopical reading is the fourth and most difficult level of reading. Instead of only reading one book, many related books are placed into a dialogue inside the reader’s mind, who actively compares and contrasts them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like an effective way to learn. I understand something new best when hearing it discussed in different ways or from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading a single book is difficult enough. Most good books are hard, and at the very least require a significant investment of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most books are also too long. Tyler Cowen agrees that the essence of most analytical books can be communicated in an article or a blog post, saving hundreds of pages of effort for both reader and writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stretchtext&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can one then expect to read piles of books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only there was a way to convert long books into succinct and to-the-point versions of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A knob you could turn, kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SparkNotes&quot;&gt;SparkNotes&lt;/a&gt;, but on demand, dynamic and catered specifically to you. Letting you dial up, or down, the fidelity on any part of a book you’re curious, or not curious, about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A device that could shorten, or fast forward through, the books you read, turning them into the equivalent of blog posts or outlines, exposing you to just the parts that mattered, or parts you would be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StretchText&quot;&gt;StretchText&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;expands or contracts the content in place, giving more control to the reader in determining what level of detail to read at.&lt;/em&gt;
—Ted Nelson, 1967&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be great aid for syntopical reading, since you’d be able to process more knowledge with greater efficiency. Instead of spending days or weeks getting one dense perspective by a single author, you can read many books in that same amount of time, getting many perspectives from different writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such technology exists that I know of yet (Stretchtext was just an idea), but below, I outline some techniques to get more out of books, faster and with less effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to read a book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of skimming or extracting the core idea of a text is central to the reading techniques described in the seminal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095&quot;&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/a&gt; by Adler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adler says that not all books should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read in full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read at the same speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some books, on the other hand, may need to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read fully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read very slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read multiple times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a reader should be able to dynamically alter their reading style based on the difficulty of a work before them, how much time they have to spend with it, and what they want to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reading techniques described in the text is called “inspectional reading”. Rather than forcing one’s way through a book page by page, cover to cover, a reader instead starts by spending a brief amount of time to “inspect” the book at hand and extract its structure and main arguments to create a sort of map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One skims the work with the goal of uncovering the skeleton (outline) the author has created in order to present the arguments (organs and flesh) of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspectional techniques include paying attention to certain things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of title and subtitle. The chapter names and their ordering. The introduction’s exposition of the main thesis and supporting arguments. The topics enumerated in the index or sources cited in the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diminishing returns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what stages of interaction with a book do you get the most out in relation to the effort put in? When do you approach diminishing returns? When is it time to change your approach or to stop reading the book altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial curiosity that gets you interested in even considering a work is likely the highest return for the least effort. I personally indulge in constantly adding books to an endless wish list on Amazon, which now counts in the thousands. I know I’ll never read most of them, but I learn from considering them and looking them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you heard that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555&quot;&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt; explains how human cognitive biases impair their daily judgement. Reading only a blurb quickly puts the big idea in your mind, with a high-level understanding of its implications. If someone mentions cognitive biases at a party, you have at least a high-level sense of what they’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman’s book is fascinating. But it is an exhaustive treatment of the topic that can be tedious to read. Inspective reading allows you to get the most out of a book with respect to the amount of time you have to devote to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a your limited free time to get a sense of the entire arc of a thesis and its supporting arguments by skimming is more useful than only getting through the first few chapters when attempting to read something from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extracting structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective written communication follows a pattern and most descriptive works are written using a common structure. Practicing identifying the structure makes extracting the main ideas of a book easier and quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, introductions at the beginning of expository books summarize the central arguments and structure of the text succinctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you plan to read something, instead of reading a long blog post or New Yorker article, try reading the introduction to a book you know you aren’t ready to devote to reading in full. After reading a good introduction, you’ll have enough familiarity with the ideas of the book to hold a high level discussion on it, and, more importantly, to have it influence your thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors often employ other standard structures. Chapter titles describe the main idea of the chapter. Chapters begin by introducing the main argument of that chapter. Skimming the first few sentences usually gives you a good sense what it is about. Chapters end with concluding remarks and a summary of the chapter. Reading both is a quick way to get a sense of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual paragraphs work in a similar way on a zoomed in scale. Paragraphs have topic sentences, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can skim a chapter by quickly reading the first sentence and last sentence of every paragraph, spending more time in sections you find more important or interesting. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A road trip without a map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading absent-mindedly from cover to cover is like driving without a map. If you’re driving across the country from New York City, you know Los Angeles is somewhere west and you’ll probably get there if you just start driving west. But why not prepare for your trip? With minimal effort, you can learn the distance of the journey ahead of time, what cities you’ll have to stop in, what the weather is in different areas, and what supplies you’ll need to bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the structure of a book ahead of reading it also gives you a map to guide you on your reading quest. It lets you anticipate what’s next, giving more context and understanding to the section you’re on now. It keeps you from getting bored, because you can speed up your reading to get to a more interesting topic that’s coming ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime soon, machine learning will likely make something similar to Stretchtext a common feature to all digital readers. Until then, we can learn more by reading piles of books better and faster by using age-old reading techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
