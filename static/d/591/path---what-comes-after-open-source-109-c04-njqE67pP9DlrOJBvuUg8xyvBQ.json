They provide new and advanced functionality that tools aren’t capable of: they are dynamic, social, and collaborative in their nature. A service’s focus on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)\">state</a> makes it fundamentally different than a tool. Its software, when instantiated, creates a vessel for persisting state. It starts off empty and becomes useful only when filled with data, users or both.</p>\n<p>The business model of internet services is predicated on monetizing state. State is a competitive advantage, and is defended by keeping services proprietary and closed. Further combinatorial innovation of services is restricted because outside developers can’t benefit from true composability of existing services and their underlying data.</p>\n<p>DNS, the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">phonebook of the internet</a>, while limited in capability, is one of a handful examples of a successful early open internet service that resulted in a lot of downstream innovation. Because of incompatible incentives, there are no open internet services today that come near to the complexity or utility of successful closed ones.</p>\n<p>That’s where crypto comes in. Crypto networks rely on open source code, but also instantiate global services that depend on open state. Open state is a critical requirement for cryptographic verification and provides the lynchpin of trust in blockchains. Tokens powering crypto network create a new incentive model aligned with openness. </p>\n<p><em>This post explores the differences between software tools and services; how the stateful nature of software services led them to be closed; and posits how crypto networks can catalyze a new era of open services that reignite combinatorial innovation.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What comes after open source?","date":"January 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-comes-after-open-source/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/reading-piles-of-books/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reading piles of books"}},"next":null}}
